# WebApp
Browser game version of the card game "Secret Hitler". It will not be the first, it will not be the best. Just a project for learning purposes.

---

This project was sadly never finished, as I moved on to other projects. But I tried multiple approaches and learned a lot about web development.
Checkout the different branches:
- [Flask](../../tree/Flask): I started with Flask as it seemed to be more beginner friendly.
- [Django](../../tree/Django): I moved to Django as I realized I needed a lot of things which were already included in Django.
- [SSE](../../tree/SSE): Sub branch from the [Django](../../tree/Django) branch to explore using Server-side events for server-client communication during a game.
- [Flask_2.0](../../tree/Flask_2.0): Starting over using Flask. After exploring what features are needed for the project, I went back to Flask. This was the final branch and the most amount of work was done here.

### Main takeaways
- working on a bigger project
- learning web development and what comes with a simple web app
- working with flask and django
- learning JavaScript, HTML and a bit of CSS
